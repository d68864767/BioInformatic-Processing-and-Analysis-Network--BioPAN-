# System Architecture

The BioInformatic Processing and Analysis Network (BioPAN) is a Node.js-based, distributed computing platform for processing and analyzing large-scale bioinformatics data. This document provides an overview of the system architecture.

## Overview

BioPAN is designed as a scalable, distributed system capable of handling large volumes of bioinformatics data. The system is divided into several components, each responsible for a specific functionality.

## Server Configuration

The server configuration is managed by the `server.js` file located in the `src/config` directory. The server is built using Express.js, a popular Node.js web application framework. The server configuration includes middleware setup, route definitions, and error handling. The server listens on the port and host specified in the `.env` file.

## Database Configuration

The database configuration is managed by the `database.js` file located in the `src/config` directory. The system uses MongoDB as its primary database, and Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library. The database connection parameters are specified in the `.env` file.

## API Layer

The API layer is responsible for handling external requests. It is divided into controllers, middleware, routes, and validators. The `dataController.js` and `analysisController.js` files located in the `src/api/controllers` directory manage genomic data requests and data analysis requests, respectively.

## Distributed Computing

The distributed computing setup is managed by the `nodeManager.js` and `taskScheduler.js` files located in the `src/distributedComputing` directory. The number of computing nodes is specified in the `.env` file.

## Bioinformatics Processing

The bioinformatics processing is handled by the `sequenceAnalysis.js` and `predictiveModeling.js` files located in the `src/bioinformatics` directory. These files contain advanced algorithms for genomic data analysis and machine learning for predictive modeling.

## Services

The business logic is encapsulated in the `dataService.js` and `analysisService.js` files located in the `src/services` directory. These services interact with the database and perform data management and analysis tasks.

## Utilities

The `logger.js` and `errorHandler.js` files located in the `src/utils` directory provide logging and error handling utilities. The logger utility uses the Winston library to log application events, and the error handler utility logs error details and sends error responses.

## Main Application Entry Point

The `app.js` file located in the `src` directory is the main application entry point. It imports and uses all the components described above to start the application.

## Testing

The system includes a comprehensive test suite divided into integration tests and unit tests. These tests are located in the `test` directory.

## Public Files and Views

The `public` directory contains publicly accessible files, including CSS stylesheets, client-side JavaScript, and the main HTML file. The `views` directory contains view templates.

## Documentation

The `docs` directory contains comprehensive project documentation, including this system architecture overview, API documentation, and a user guide.

## Utility Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains utility scripts for setup and deployment.

## Environment Variables

The `.env` file contains environment variables used for server configuration, database configuration, distributed computing configuration, and API keys.

## Dependencies

The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files manage the project's dependencies.

## Version Control

The `.gitignore` file specifies files and directories that are not tracked by Git.

## Project Overview and Documentation

The `README.md` file provides an overview of the project and links to the documentation.
