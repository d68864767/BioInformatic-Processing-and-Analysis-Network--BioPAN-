## Getting Started

To start using BioPAN, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone the BioPAN repository and install the dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BioPAN.git
cd BioPAN
npm install
```

## Configuration

Before you start the server, you need to set up the environment variables. You can find these variables in the `.env` file at the root of the project. Here is a brief explanation of each variable:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
- `HOST`: The host of the server.
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`: These variables are used for configuring the database connection.
- `COMPUTING_NODES`: The number of computing nodes for distributed computing.
- `API_KEY`, `SECRET`: These are used for API authentication.

## API Usage

BioPAN provides two main APIs: Data API and Analysis API. You can access these APIs at `/api/data` and `/api/analysis` respectively.

### Data API

The Data API is used for managing genomic data. You can use this API to upload, retrieve, update, and delete genomic data.

### Analysis API

The Analysis API is used for analyzing genomic data. You can use this API to perform various analysis tasks on the genomic data.

## Error Handling

BioPAN uses a custom error handling middleware for handling errors. If an error occurs during the processing of a request, the error will be logged and an error response will be sent to the client.

## Logging

BioPAN uses the Winston logging library for logging. The logs are printed to the console and also saved to a file named `combined.log`.

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

For more detailed information, please refer to the API documentation and the system architecture overview.
